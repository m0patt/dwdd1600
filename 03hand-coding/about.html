            <h2>MEET OUR FOUNDER</h2>
                <p>Morgan Patterson, Founder of <b>HAVEANICEDAY Thrift</b>, fell in love with thrifting in her teenage years as she was living in Southern California. Growing up in SoCal, gave her the opportunity to live within 20 miles of hundreds of different types of thrift and vintage stores. The vintage store that sparked her desire to begin reselling thrifted and vintage pieces, was La Bomba Vintage Store located in Long Beach, California. This store would host "vintage pile sales" every first Saturday of the month. The pile of vintage clothes reached the ceiling, and climbing on top of the pile to look through the articles of clothing was highly encouraged. Every saturday the piles would be packed with individuals of all ages, digging to find their dream vintage pieces. <br>
